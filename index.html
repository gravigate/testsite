				first being the rules that they all follow, called laws. The second being the shared 
				management of resources found whithin the borders of their society. These resources
				include land, raw materials, food, water, energy, and people.</p>
				
				 <p class="lead">People living in democratic countries organise themselves into smaller
				 groups of roughly equal size, and each group vote for a single individual to represent
				 them. This group of elected officials is called a government. The government must then 
				 ensure that the society's laws represent the views of the people, and that the society's 
				 resources are used in a way that the people want them to be used.</p>

				 <p class="lead">People are the greatest resource a society has. People are brilliant, 
				 resourceful, helpful, and kind. Work is when a person does something that benefits their 
				 society. One way for societies to make sure that people engage in beneficial work is 
				 to create a resource called a currency, and a law called a tax.</p>
				 
				 <p class="lead">If a society needs work to be done, it can demand a payment in it's 
				 currency from it's people. It can then promise to pay it's people that currency to do that
				 work. This arrangement ensures that the work gets done.</p>
				 
				 <p class="lead">When a government demands less currency in taxes than it issues for work,
				 the extra is called a deficit. People can then trade this extra currency in a market. The 
				 larger the deficit, the more currency the market has to trade.</p>
				 
				 <p class="lead">If the people in a society demand that the society's resources be used in 
				 a particular way, it is the government's job to procure those resources. The government can
				 procure any resource that is priced in that society's currency, as the society issues the 
				 currency.</p>
				 
				 <p class="lead">In some cases, the government may procure so much of a resource that there 
				 isn't any left for the market to purchase. That can lead to a rise in the price of that 
				 resource. A price that society can always pay, but the market cannot. In this case, the 
				 market can either increase the supply of this resource, or reduce it's demand by replacing
				 that resource with another.</p>
				 
				 <p class="lead">Any resource that cannot be replaced by another should not be traded in a
				 market.</p>
