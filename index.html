			The government is responsible for procuring resources from the market to fund institutions 
			that supply public services. Those public services are required to maintain a foundation from 
			which a market can grow.
			</br></br>
			The government procures resources by first issuing currency, then exchanging that currency for 
			goods and services. The government ensures that the currency it issues will be accepted by first 
			levying a tax on producers that must be paid in that currency. 
			</br></br>
			The issuance of new currency, combined with the reduction in resources, may lead to supply 
			constraints on certain goods and services. These constraints are mostly reversed by market forces, 
			either by competition, or when producers invest the income generated by an increase in demand to 
			further increase supply. 
			</br></br>
			In an environment when producers cannot or will not invest capital to increase supply, the government 
			can either enact policies which increase supply, or reduce demand by levying taxes.
			</br></br>
			In an environment where the government is ideologically opposed to the government procurement of 
			private resources, they will insist that limits are imposed on the amount of resources it can procure. 
			These limits take the form of either balanced fiscal policy or bond issuance.
