                <h1>AN ADVENTURE BEGINS</h1>
                <p>As part of the Dwarven fleet’s plan to invade the Orc homeworld of Old Rock, 
                    military outposts were constructed at strategic locations under the surface of the planet’s 
                    moons. In retaliation, the Orcs deployed shock troops to engage in guerilla style skirmishes 
                    against the Dwarven installations. That was nearly 200 years ago.</p>
                <p>Now, in the wake of the Asmodeun Crusade, the recolonisation of abandoned settlements has 
                    begun. Humanoids from across the system now feel bold enough to return to these old frontiers 
                    to seek new fortunes.</p>
                <p>Phandal, the smallest moon orbiting Old Rock, now finds itself home to an up-and-coming frontier 
                    outpost dubbed Phandal-IN. About a mile outside this settlement is where your ship has crashed.</p>
                <p>The ship’s diagnostics inform you that it’s beyond repair with the materials you have to hand. 
                    You grab your pack and your weapons, affix your respirator, and step out of the escape hatch  
                    onto a carpet of thick yellow grass. You move a few paces backwards to make space between 
                    yourself and the sparking, smoking pile of metal that was once your ship.</p>
                <p>You start walking, following a small stream North until the surrounding dark blue foliage 
                    begins to thin. On the horizon you spot the outpost of Phandal-IN, nestled in a valley 
                    between two jagged peaks. The sunlight glistens off the settlement’s protective dome.</p>
                <p>As you reach the outskirts of the dome you raise a hand and the airlock opens. Now that 
                    you’re inside, you can remove your respirator. Two rows of single-story square metal 
                    structures are separated by a dirt track that leads into the centre of town. There you 
                    find a slightly larger building, a sign across the door reads ‘Freshments’.</p>
                <p>You enter what appears to be a regular looking bar. A few humans with laz-axes are eating 
                    breakfast at a table in the far corner, while slightly closer you spot a table of dwarves.
                     A droid is standing with it’s back to you taking the dwarves orders. As you enter, the 
                     droid’s head spins round 360 degrees and says in a robotic tone “Good morning. 
                     I am Toblin-12. Welcome to Freshments. How may I be of service?”</p>
