			<strong>Currency Sovereignty</strong><br>
					A currency sovereign nation creates and controls its own money. 
					It usually operates a central bank that creates and issues currency 
					to public institutions and private banks. Democratic currency sovereign 
					nations can instruct their central bank to issue new money to fund national 
					public institutions.
			<br><br>
			<strong>Workforce Stabilization</strong><br>
					Public institutions can use this money to insure that the working age 
					population is able to be productive. To participate in the workforce a citizen 
					must be safe, healthy, skilled, and motivated. If the private sector cannot 
					provide work to everyone at a socially inclusive wage, public institutions can 
					by exercising currency sovereignty.
			<br><br>
			<strong>National Investment</strong><br>
					Currency issuance allows public institutions to acquire the materials and labor 
					needed to ensure a democratically desired level of productivity. Security, 
					infrastructure, and a legal framework are foundational requirements of a capitalist 
					market economy.
			<br><br>
			<strong>Supply Restrictions</strong><br>
					National institutions are limited by the amount of available goods and labor 
					required to fulfill their democratic mandates. If a nation competes with capitalists 
					for resources, the price of those specific resources may temporarily increase. Healthy 
					capitalist markets react to this increase in demand by increasing supply, or producing 
					an alternative resource.
			<br><br>
			<strong>Increased Demand</strong><br>
					Newly issued currency that is transferred to the private sector may result in supply 
					restrictions whereby the price of specific resources may temporarily increase. Healthy 
					capitalist markets react to this increase in demand by increasing supply, or producing 
					an alternative resource. This new currency ultimately falls under the ownership of the 
					capitalists providing the resources.
			<br><br>
			<strong>Wealth Instability</strong><br>
					Excessive private wealth can lead to corruption of democratic systems and negative public 
					sentiment. A democratic nation can levy taxes to remove excessive wealth from the economy. 
					This is done to ensure democratic stability and temper negative reactions to wealth inequality.
